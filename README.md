This is a simple React app that demonstrates full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using React Router, react-hook-form, and localStorage for product management.

📦 Products are stored in the browser's localStorage

🔄 Uses react-hook-form for efficient form handling and validation

🌐 Client-side routing with react-router-dom

✏️ Add, edit, delete, and view product details

Perfect for learning or demonstrating basic React CRUD concepts without a backend!
